WAWAS:

FAQ:

1. Why WAWAS is much more than a simple WebServer ?

WAWAS is an Application Server, same as Tomcat for example.
You can use WAWAS to embed PSP pages (PHP-Server-Pages), 
PHP Beans or PHP Servlets.
The whole object components is available to build powerfull 
application on this technologies with PHP 5




2. Why all the objects are called "WAWASSomething" ?

The goal of WAWAS is to integrate directly your PHP code as beans, servlets, etc without using 
any CGI interfase.
To not interfere with your objects and with standards objects, we decided to name all the basic
WAWAS objects this way. 
Do not name your objects WAWASSomething !
